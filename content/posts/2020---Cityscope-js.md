The CityScope project combines physical 3D models, augmented reality, and real-time prediction to support experts and non-experts in a novel decision-making process to design better cities. Work was done within the City Science Lab at MIT Media Lab.

**My contributions:** Mobility Simulation Layer, Save/Load Scenarios, Edit Grid Mode enhancements, migrated codebase to React (functional components)
