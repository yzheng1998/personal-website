[![Give Essential Demo](/media/give-essential-demo.png)](https://www.giveessential.org/)

Established during the initial coronavirus crisis, Give Essential matches essential workers in need of household items with donors who are able to give them.

**My Contributions:** I built the front-end of the website from scratch using React and Styled-Components. I designed and developed a NoSQL backend using Cloud Firestore, Express, and Node.js to manage user accounts and donation requests/submissions. I wrote an efficient matching algorithm to match donors with essential workers based on user
selections, which has matched over 5,000 donations.
