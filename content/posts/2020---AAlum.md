A dating app (React-native ios/Android) exclusive to college students and graduates. I worked as project manager on this app for 5 months, managing a team of 3 frontend engineers, 2 backend engineers, and 1 UX/UI designer. I wrote and assigned issues, contributed and reviewed code, and was the primary communicator with the client.
