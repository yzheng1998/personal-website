description: "Visual component of my undergraduate senior thesis. I created an interactive timeline of the historical maps of Venice, highlighting urban form changes to show correlation with Venice’s population over time (1603 - 1920). In my thesis, I plan to argue that the first and only land bridge (1846) connecting Venice to mainland Italy was greatly influential in bringing about the population boom incited in 1851.

Visual component of my undergraduate senior thesis. I created an interactive timeline of the historical maps of Venice, highlighting urban form changes to show correlation with Venice’s population over time (1603 - 1920). In my thesis, I plan to argue that the first and only land bridge (1846) connecting Venice to mainland Italy was greatly influential in bringing about the population boom incited in 1851.
