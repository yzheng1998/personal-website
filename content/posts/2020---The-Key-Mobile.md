A professional networking app (React-native, ios) that allows users to easily and casually meet people in their academic/career fields. Completed and published to the App Store (2018).

I was the lead front-end engineer for this project for 5 months (full time job in Summer 2018), contributing more than 50% of the frontend code. Built screens, base components, swipe functionality, text-input validation, redux, and more.
