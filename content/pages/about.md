![About Me Pic](/media/about-me.jpg)

I am currently a senior at Harvard University, pursuing an A.B. in Computer Science and History of Art and Architecture. My background consists of four years of web and app development. My thesis research focuses on developing cartographic visualizations that assist in analyzing the historical relationship between urban design and population growth in the shrinking city of Venice. My primary interests exist in the intersection of data visualization, computer science, urban design and architecture.
