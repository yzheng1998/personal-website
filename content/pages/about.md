I recently graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. in Computer Science and History of Art and Architecture. My background consists of five years of full stack web and app development, along with project and product management. I most recently worked at Jane Street Capital as a Business Development Analyst and as part of the founding team of a steath cybersecurity startup. My primary interests exist in the intersection of computer science, fintech, data visualization, urban design and architecture.
