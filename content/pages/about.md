I recently graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. in Computer Science and History of Art and Architecture. My background consists of four years of web and app development. I am working at Jane Street Capital in the Rotational Development Program. My primary interests exist in the intersection of data visualization, computer science, finance, urban design and architecture.
